# Packet Sniffer in Python

## Project 1: CodeAlpha Internship

### Overview
This project is part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**. The goal of this project is to create a simple **Packet Sniffer** in Python. A packet sniffer is a tool that captures and analyzes network packets traveling across a network. It can be used for debugging network issues, monitoring traffic, or even for security analysis.

### Features
- Capture and display network packets.
- Display packet details such as source IP, destination IP, protocol type, and payload.
- Support for capturing packets over different protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP).
- Real-time packet sniffing and logging.

### Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/althaf009/CodeAlpha_TASK_1.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd CodeAlpha_TASK_1
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python sniffer.py
    ```

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Use Cases
- **Network Monitoring**: Use the packet sniffer to monitor traffic on your network.
- **Security Analysis**: Understand potential vulnerabilities by observing incoming and outgoing packets.
- **Debugging**: Debug network issues by analyzing the types of packets being sent/received.
